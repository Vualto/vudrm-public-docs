## Instructions

### Install dependencies

3. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:Vualto/vuplay-jwplayer.git`
4. Navigate to the project's root folder: `cd vuplay-jwplayer`
5. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

### Set required variables

1. Open the repo in your favourite javascript editor.
2. In the file `vuplay.js` replace `<mpeg-dash-stream-url>` with your [MPEG-DASH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Adaptive_Streaming_over_HTTP) stream url.

4. In the file `vuplay.js` replace `<vudrm-token>` with a vudrm token from [https://admin.drm.technology](https://admin.drm.technology)

### Build and run the code

This repo contains a development node.js server. This server is not suitable for production.

1. Add the host `jwplayer.vuplay.local.drm.technology` to your local machine's hosts file.
2. Run `grunt serve --jwplayer-key=<your-jwplayer-key>`, replacing `<your-jwplayer-key>` with your jwplayer key.
3. Load a supported browser and go to `https://jwplayer.vuplay.local.drm.technology:14703`

You will need an enterprise license with JWPlayer in order to playback DRM encrypted content. Please contact support@vualto.com or [JWPlayer](https://www.jwplayer.com/pricing/) for more information. To retrieve the jwplayer key [click here](https://dashboard.jwplayer.com/#/players/downloads) and copy the license key for the appropriate player in the `Downloads` section.

In order to allow DRM encrypted playback in chrome (https://goo.gl/EEhZqT), SSL has been enabled for the demo. You will get a warning about an invalid cert `NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID` but this can safely be ignored.

### Browser support

The browser must support [encrypted media extensions](https://www.w3.org/TR/2016/CR-encrypted-media-20160705/).
Currently this includes the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer 11 and Edge.
For a complete breakdown of supported media extensions please contact support@vualto.com
